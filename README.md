# genai_job_candidate_agent
Objective: Demonstrate the use case of Generative AI by creating a personal Digital Twin Job
Interviewee Agent to interact with recruiters and hiring managers. Utilizing prompt engineering, the
Agent will retrieve my personal knowledge data (e.g., my resume, sample interview answers) through
the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and use the relevant information to respond
effectively.

The resume and sample interview answers in the RAG folder is the key component to create this personalized chatbot. The tilte of the document is the interview question, and the content is my interview answer. If you wish to duplicate this app with your own data, you can recreate the RAG documents, then tune with the prompt template in the code for better result.
